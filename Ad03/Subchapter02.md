# Setting the engineering station IP address
You need a TCP/IP connection to program a SIMATIC S7-1200 controller from the PC, the programming device or a laptop.

It is important that the IP addresses of both devices match for the PC and
SIMATIC S7-1200 to communicate with each other via TCP/IP.

* Locate the network icon ![](../Ad03/Images/Network_icon.jpg) in the taskbar at the bottom and click on "Network settings".
