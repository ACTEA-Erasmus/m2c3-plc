# The railroad bridge project
_____________________________________
## Overview
-   The [first goal](Ex02/Subchapter04_01.md) is to configure and to download the hardware of a PLC device
-   The [second goal](Ex02/Subchapter04_02.md) is to debug hardware errors
-   The [third goal](Ex02/Subchapter04_03.md) is to create and to download basic software, according IEC 61131-3
-   The [fourth goal](Ex02/Subchapter04_04.md) is to debug software errors and programming faults
-   The [last goal](Ex02/Subchapter04_05.md) is to deliver a working project

Back to the [project scope](Ex02/Subchapter04.md).

## Goal 2 : Debug hardware errors
**Go online** and check the device configuration on errors in the “Device view”.
>There should be some faults in your configuration:
>- Is there really a signal board into your CPU?
>- Is there really an digital input module added to your CPU?

**Debug** these faults!
>Change the ""*Offline*"" hardware configuration until it match with your device.
>Download the hardware configuration and check your “*Online view*” for errors.
>Repeat this until your configuration is error-free.
