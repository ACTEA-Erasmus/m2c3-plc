# The railroad bridge project
## Overview
-   The [first goal](Ex02/Subchapter04_01.md) is to configure and to download the hardware of a PLC device
-   The [second goal](Ex02/Subchapter04_02.md) is to debug hardware errors
-   The [third goal](Ex02/Subchapter04_03.md) is to create and to download basic software, according IEC 61131-3
-   The [fourth goal](Ex02/Subchapter04_04.md) is to debug software errors and programming faults
-   The [last goal](Ex02/Subchapter04_05.md) is to deliver a working project

Back to the [project scope](Ex02/Subchapter04.md).

## Goal 2 : Debug hardware errors
**Step 1 :** Go online and check the device configuration on hardware errors in the “Device view”. Use the online icons to check on errors.

```javascript
There should be some faults in your configuration:
- Is there really a signal board into your CPU?
- Is there really an digital input module added to your CPU?
```

**Step 2 :** Debug these faults!
```javascript
Change the offline hardware configuration until it match with your device.
Download the hardware configuration and check your “Online view” for errors.
Repeat this until your configuration is error-free.
```
