# The watertank project
## Overview
-   The [first goal](Ex07/Subchapter04_01.md) is to program the AD conversion of an analog input
-   The [second goal](Ex07/Subchapter04_02.md) is to program a high level alarm control circuit
-   The [third goal](Ex07/Subchapter04_03.md) is to program start-stop control circuit
-   The [fourth goal](Ex07/Subchapter04_04.md) is to control the level
-   The [last goal](Ex07/Subchapter04_05.md) is to deliver a working project

## Scope
Automate the level in **watertank T1**. that is equipped with
- An analog level sensor
- An analog flow sensor on the outlet
- An analog inlet valve
- An analog outlet valve
