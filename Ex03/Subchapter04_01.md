## Goal 1 : recognize working principles
**Step 1 :** Open the Real Games Factory IO scene [The Pusher Game.factoryio](../Ex03/Documents/The_Pusher_Game.factoryio)

**Step 2 :** Test the scene manually in RUN mode by moving the box around.
```javascript
Go to the RUN mode by clicking on the play button and activate the actuator Tags.
Click on actuator Tags so you can force them to move.
```
**Step 3 :** Explore the control cabinet with the first person camera
```javascript
Nothing happens when you push on the buttons. Why?
Because there is no PLC connected that contains the software.
```
**Step 4 :** Test all the cameras and create your own camera positions
```javascript
Go to the Cameras item in the VIEW menu to create camera positions.
Can you remove the box from the playground?
```
