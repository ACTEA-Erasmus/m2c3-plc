## Scope
Create a solution for the pusher game where a carton box is pushed around over and over until the game is stopped.

![The Pusher Game](../Ex03/Images/The_Pusher_Game.jpg)

It is necessary to foreseen some advantages such as:
-  The speed of the game must be controllable by means of a turn knob
-  The number of "rounds" is showed on a display
-  The number of "rounds" must be reset to zero every time the game is started
-  The game may not count "rounds" if the speed is to high if at least one pusher is to slow
