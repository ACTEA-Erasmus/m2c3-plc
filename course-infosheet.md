## Learing outcomes
This course starts with an introduction into the world of PLC’s and automation
where a student learns that automation is more than programming.

It continuous with the hardware and software architecture of a PLC. The student learns the modular concept of a PLC, the software architecture following IEC 61131 and software programming of basic instructions, math instructions, conversion instructions, timers and counters in different programming languages according IEC 61131.

After this part of the course a student is able to define hardware and software solutions for a small basic automation project.

The course continuous with hands-on workshops where students apply their
knowledge to develop technology skills. The student learns to configure PLC hardware, to troubleshoot PLC hardware and software problems in
real-time.

At the end of this course a student is able to analyse small basic automation problems and to work out a solution (=mainly digital IO directly connected to the CPU and total amount of IO is less then 25).
