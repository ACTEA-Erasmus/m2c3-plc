# Emergency stop circuits
-   The [first goal](Ex06/Subchapter04_01.md) is to wire the electrical circuit for a direct online motor starter with safety relay logic.
-   The [second goal](Ex06/Subchapter04_02.md)  is to program and test PLC software for a direct online motor starter with safety relay logic.

Back to the [project scope](Ex06/Subchapter04.md).

## Goal 1 : Wire the electrical circuit for a direct online motor starter with safety relay logic
**Step 1 :** The following electrical digital input connections, the ones noted with a green star should be done.

**For safety reasons, electrical connections must be made with safety leads while the power is switched off! Students are not allowed to switch on the power!**
